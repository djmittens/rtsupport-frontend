# Real Time Support desk ui

Built as part of a course on reactjs, go and websockets.

## Setting up
in order to work with this code you gotta have webpack installed, so

```
npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
```

Then obviously install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Then run the dev server like so
```
webpack-dev-server --devtool source-map
```

Happy coding.
